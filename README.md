- 👋 Hi, I’m @Noobnate
- 👀 I’m interested in getting involved with the cyber community ...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML and calculus...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something relevant. I am digitally dumb, but I am confident in my mathematical ability. I feel that my security stance would be the first concern. I have failed to make a single connection in this two and a half years. I am not 100% certain of what this implies. So I will attempt to put in some work!
- 📫 How to reach me?    Hell, I don't know how to reach myself...
